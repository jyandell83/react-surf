#### Things to work on
- The biggest thing that I need to work on is organizing the CSS and redoing the style. I have learned so much about web design since I made this page.
- build out the spot profile page with buoy data
- show error message when user doesn't use a proper password
- style some of the forms
- possibly link to another API for data about local shops or restaurants, gas stations etc.
